        Jessica Fletcher has had plenty to worry about over her storied career, both as a bestselling novelist and amateur
    sleuth. But she never had any reason to worry about her longtime publisher, Lane Barfield, who also happens to be a trusted
    friend. When mounting evidence of financial malfeasance leads to an FBI investigation of Lane, Jessica can’t believe what
    she’s reading. So when Barfield turns up dead, Jessica takes on the task of proving Barfield’s innocence–she can’t fathom
    someone she’s known and trusted for so long cheating her. Sure enough, Jessica’s lone wolf investigation turns up several
    oddities and inconsistencies in Barfield’s murder. Jessica knows something is being covered up, but what exactly? The trail
    she takes to answer that question reveals something far more nefarious afoot, involving shadowy characters from the heights
    of power in Washington. At the heart of Jessica’s investigation lies a manuscript Barfield had intended to bring out after
    all other publishers had turned it down. The problem is that manuscript has disappeared, all traces of its submission and
    very existence having been wiped off the books. With her own life now in jeopardy, Jessica refuses to back off and sets her
    sights on learning the contents of that manuscript and what about it may have led to several murders. Every step she takes
    brings her closer to the truth of what lies in the pages, as well as the person who penned them.
